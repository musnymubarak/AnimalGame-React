The Object Recognition Game is designed to enhance children's object recognition and language skills. It presents an engaging and interactive way for children to learn animal names while improving their cognitive abilities.

The game displays an animal name on the left side of the screen, and the player must select the correct image from a grid of 16 animal pictures. Immediate feedback is provided based on the player's choice.
